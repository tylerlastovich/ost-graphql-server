# OST • GraphQL Server
Looking to get started using the OST APIs really quickly?  This is a small turn-key project that sets up a Node/Express development server running Apollo GraphQL.

```Bash
cd ost-graphql-sandbox
npm install
vi logic/conf.js # add your OST API keys and Apollo service ID
npm start
# Server should be running on localhost:<GRAPHQL_PORT>/graphiql!
```
